<div>
    Given an array of string <strong>words</strong> and a width <strong>maxWidth</strong>, <br />
    format the text such that each line has exactly <strong>maxWidth</strong> characters and is
    fully (left and right) justified.
    <br />
    You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each
    line. <br />
    Pad extra spaces <strong>' '</strong> when necessary so that each line has exactly
    <strong>maxWidth</strong>
    characters.
    <br />
    <br />
    Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces
    <br />
    on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned
    more <br />
    spaces than the slots on the right. <br />
    For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between
    words. <br />
    <br />
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <strong>word</strong> is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space
            characters only.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than <strong>0</strong> and not exceed
            <strong>maxWidth</strong> .
        </li>
        <li>The input array <strong>words</strong> contains at least one word.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Constraints:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 <= words.length <= 300</li>
        <li>1 <= words[i].length <= 20</li>
        <li>words[i].length <= maxWidth</li>
    </ul>

    Read initial text from the file <code>input.txt</code>. Write result text to
    <code>output.txt</code>. <br />
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <hr />
    <tt>input.txt</tt>
    <pre>
This is an example of text justification.
